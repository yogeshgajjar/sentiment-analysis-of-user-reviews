Preprocessing methods for Sentiment Analysis

1) Tokanization using NLTK library. 
It means three things 
- Break the sentence into words 
- Understand the importance of each word 
- Produce structural description 

2) Bigrams, Trigrams and Ngrams 
Representation of words in pairs, three words and N words. 

syntax = quotes_ngrams = list(ntlk.ngrams(quotes_tokens, N)) 

3) Stemming 
Refers to normalizing into its base form or root form 
from ntlk.stem import PorterStemmer 
pst = PorterStemmer() 

pst.stem("having") 

4) Lemmatization 
Similar to stemming as it maps several words into common words 
Better than stemming 
from nltk.stem import wordnet
from ntlk.stem import WordnetLematizer
word_len = Wordnet.Lemmatizzer()

5) Stopwords 
words not required in NLP such as I, am, the etc 

6) Parts of Speech 
- A tag which catagorizes the words of the sentence
tokanize it, and apply nltk.pos_tag([token])
