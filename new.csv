1	Good case, Excellent value.
2	Great for the jawbone.
3	Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!
4	The mic is great.
5	I have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume.
6	If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.

8	Needless to say, I wasted my money.
9	What a waste of money and time!.
10	And the sound quality is great.

12	If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
13	Very good quality though
14	"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."
15	Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
16	I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!
17	So Far So Good!.
18	Works great!.
19	It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.
20	I went on Motorola's website and followed all directions, but could not get it to pair again.
21	I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!

32	It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.

48	This case seems well made.
49	Disappointed with battery.
50	Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.
51	good protection and does not make phone too bulky.

54	I love this thing!
55	Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.

58	I have been very happy with the 510 and have had NO complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end.
59	The buttons for on and off are bad.
60	Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
61	I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.
62	These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.
63	Buy a different phone - but not this.
64	You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.
65	The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
66	A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.
67	It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.

93	The ear buds only play music in one ear.
94	Dont waste your money...
95	Will order from them again!
96	If you plan to use this in a car forget about it.
97	I found this product to be waaay too big.
98	Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
99	I'm very disappointed with my decision.
100	Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.
101	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
102	Definitely a bargain.
103	The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
104	I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.
105	Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.
106	That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).
107	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.
108	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
109	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
110	Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.
111	This phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful.
112	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
113	Great product, fast shipping!.
114	Absolutely great.
115	The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.
116	i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.
117	It is very comfortable on the ear.
118	It has been a winner for us.
119	)Setup couldn't have been simpler.
120	I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.
121	Could not get strong enough signal.
122	Iam very pleased with my purchase.
123	Bad Quality.
124	Gets the job done.
125	Great audio!.
126	Basically the service was very bad.
127	it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
128	I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.
129	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
130	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
131	The accompanied software is almost brilliant.
132	Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
133	!I definitly recommend!!
134	Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
135	The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.
136	Very good stuff for the price.
137	My headset works just peachy-keen.
138	In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.
139	Voice recognition is tremendous!
140	What a waste.
141	During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.

147	Its reception is very very poor.
148	Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
149	After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
150	I Was Hoping for More.
151	Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
152	I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!
153	I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.
154	I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.
155	This phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used.
156	Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.
157	This item is fantastic and works perfectly!
158	And I just love the colors!
159	W810i is just SUPERB.
160	All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.
161	Great charger.
162	This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.
163	Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
164	I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.
165	Great Value.
166	Doesn't work at all.. I bougth it for my L7c and its not working.
167	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.

169	One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.
170	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.
171	Thank you for wasting my money.
172	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
173	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
174	The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.
175	Superb Phone on a Great Network.
176	I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.
177	I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.
178	It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
179	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
180	Don't buy this product.
181	I've had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear.
182	The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.
183	I have this phone and it is a thorn in my side, I really abhor it.
184	I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.
185	Incredible!.
186	Design Flaw?.
187	Great phone!.
188	Waste of 13 bucks.
189	But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
190	The replacement died in a few weeks.
191	Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..
192	Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.
193	I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.
194	Not impressed.
195	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.
196	You'll love how thin it is.
197	Bad Choice.
198	The pleather case doesn't fit.
199	useless phone, simply deaf.
200	The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.
201	All in all I think it was a good investment.
202	It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.
203	The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.
204	Battery lasts only a few hours.
205	great headset, very impressed - H500.
206	"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7."
207	I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
208	Good transmit audio.
209	We are sending it back.
210	I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.
211	If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.
212	Great price also!
213	The range is very decent, I've been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no reception/sound quality issues.
214	fast service.
215	I would highly recommend this.
216	I would recommend this.
217	"I also didn't like the ""on"" button, it felt like it would crack with use."
218	WORST PHONE EVER.
219	I'm still infatuated with this phone.
220	Freezes frequently4.
221	It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.
222	Simple, lightweight and great fit.
223	All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.
224	There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.
225	These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.
226	I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.
227	I'm a bit disappointed.
228	I have had this phone for over a year now, and I will tell you, its not that great.
229	I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).
230	The battery is completely useless to me.

244	It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
245	Worth every penny.
246	Excellent wallet type phone case.
247	Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
248	Internet is excrutiatingly slow.
249	It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.
250	It's fits like a glove and is strong, secure, and durable.
251	O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.
252	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.
253	I love all the features and form factor.
254	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
255	poor quality and service.
256	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.
257	Great Earpiece.

297	This one works and was priced right.
298	Customer service was terrible.
299	Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.

304	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.
305	I received it quickly and it works great!!
306	Has been working great.
307	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.
308	My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.
309	They do not care about the consumer one bit.
310	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.
311	The instruction manual is lacking.
312	Also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case.
313	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
314	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
315	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
316	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
317	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
318	I want my money back.
319	I love this device.
320	I am also very happy with the price.
321	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
322	The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.
323	I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.
324	I have 2-3 bars on my cell phone when I am home, but you cant not hear anything.
325	good item, low price.
326	However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
327	The plug did not work very well.
328	AMAZON SUCKS.
329	Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
330	VERY comfortable.
331	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
332	The reception is excellent!
333	It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.
334	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.
335	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
336	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
337	Very disappointing.
338	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.
339	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
340	Excellent sound quality.
341	Was not happy.
342	A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
343	New Battery works great in phone.
344	Worst customer service.
345	I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).
346	Reception is terrible and full of static.
347	Good audio quality.
348	This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.
349	I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.
350	Were JERKS on the phone.
351	Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.
352	Comfortable, Nice Range, Good Battery Life.
353	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
354	Excellent starter wireless headset.
355	The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
356	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
357	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.
358	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
359	The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.
360	Nice design and quality.
361	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.
362	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.
363	bad fit, way too big.
364	It definitely was not as good as my S11.
365	awesome device.
366	Waste of money.
367	I had ordered a motorola data cable, got a very well finished and working product.
368	Love This Phone.
369	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
370	I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
371	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
372	Battery life is also great!
373	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
374	Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.
375	This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.
376	Protects the phone on all sides.
377	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
378	Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.
379	Soyo technology sucks.
380	Great Hands Free Device.
381	you can even take self portraits with the outside (exterior) display, very cool.
382	Same problem as others have mentioned.
383	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
384	Magical Help.
385	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
386	Poor sound quality.
387	The best phone in market :).
388	It worked very well.
389	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
390	Exactly what I wanted.
391	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
392	This is a great deal.
393	Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.
394	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
395	Better than you'd expect.
396	Using all earpieces, left or right, this thing will not stay on my ear.
397	Great product and price.

400	what a disappointment
401	Very prompt service.
402	Excellent product for the price.
403	Very pleased with this headset.
404	don't waste your money and time.
405	I especially love the long battery life.
406	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.
407	Works great.
408	Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.
409	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.
410	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.
411	I highly recommend this device to everyone!
412	Jawbone Era is awesome too!
413	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
414	After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.
415	I have used several phone in two years, but this one is the best.
416	An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.
417	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
418	Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.
419	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.
420	Price is good too.
421	Don't make the same mistake I did.
422	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
423	I'm using it with an iriver SPINN (with case) and it fits fine.
424	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
425	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
426	every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.
427	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
428	IT'S REALLY EASY.
429	My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.
430	Fantastic earphones.
431	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
432	Low Quality.
433	I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.
434	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
435	Warning - Stay away.
436	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
437	Awsome Device Works Great!!.
438	I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.
439	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
440	Very Displeased.
441	I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.
442	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
443	Restored my phone to like new performance.
444	I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.
445	I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.
446	Does not fit.
447	Very happy with this product.
448	The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.
449	There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.
450	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.
451	Portable and it works.
452	My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.
453	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.
454	I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
455	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
456	Timely shipment and quality product.
457	Nice solid keyboard.
458	Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.
459	Horrible phone.
460	BT50 battery junk!.
461	We would recommend these to others.
462	Cant get the software to work with my computer.
463	Disappointed!.
464	poor voice clarity.
465	The battery works great!
466	No buyers remorse on this one!.
467	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
468	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
469	"Looks great and is strong."""
470	I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.
471	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
472	Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.
473	Great software for Motorolas.
474	The delivery was on time.
475	Very easy to use.
476	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).
477	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
478	It holds a charge for a long time, is reasonably comfortable under long-wearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous.
479	I'd like to return it.
480	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
481	Verizon's bills, however, are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple.
482	After charging overnight, these batteries work great.
483	You won't regret it!
484	I love this phone!.
485	A Disappointment.
486	Its not user friendly.
487	Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.
488	Then I exchanged for the same phone, even that had the same problem.
489	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
490	This PDA rocks.
491	It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone, and excels in those roles.
492	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!
493	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
494	Pretty piece of junk.
495	Plug was the wrong size.
496	Works as described.
497	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.
498	Bad Purchase.
499	WELL IM SATISFIED.
500	The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.
501	This battery is an excellent bargain!
502	Defective crap.
503	I would have given no star if I was able.
504	I wear glasses and it fits fine with them.
505	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.
506	I would not recommend this item to anyone.
507	The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad.
508	great...no problems at all!.
509	As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.
510	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.
511	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
512	The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.
513	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
514	very good product, well made.
515	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
516	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
517	I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.
518	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
519	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.
520	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
521	Thanks again to Amazon for having the things I need for a good price!
522	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
523	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
524	Works great!.
525	REALLY UGLY.
526	horrible, had to switch 3 times.
527	The noise shield is incrediable.
528	No real improvement.
529	Razr Battery - Good buy.
530	Keep up the good work Amazon!!
531	They refuse to refund or replace.
532	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
533	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
534	Great case and price!
535	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
536	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
537	Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.
538	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
539	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
540	I am glad I purchased it.
541	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
542	Perhaps my phone is defective, but people cannot hear me when I use this.
543	Don't buy this product.
544	sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.
545	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.
546	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
547	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
548	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
549	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.
550	I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.
551	Thank you for such great service.
552	Its a total package.
553	The seller is very understanding and patient, I would definitely buy from them again.
554	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
555	It's AGGRAVATING!
556	Great product for the price!.
557	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
558	Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!
559	None of it works, just don't buy it.
560	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.
561	Please dont waste your money.
562	All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.
563	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.
564	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
565	Disapointing Results.
566	Cumbersome design.
567	Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!
568	Great Product.
569	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
570	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
571	This fixes all the problems.
572	Worst ever.
573	I am very happy
574	I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.
575	"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?"""
576	The battery life is highly unacceptable.
577	That company is a joke.
578	It does everything the description said it would.
579	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
580	It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.
581	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.
582	Voice Quality, Signal Strength, Dropped Calls.
583	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.
584	Better than expected.
585	It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.
586	Battery is holding up well.
587	Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.
588	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.
589	I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.
590	Sprint - terrible customer service.
591	Linked to my phone without effort.
592	THey are so cool!
593	Easy to use.
594	Better Than New.
595	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...
596	Piece of trash.
597	A pretty good product.
598	This is a great phone!.
599	For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.
600	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.
601	The real killer is the volume, and of course it breaking.
602	Those phones are working just fine now.
603	I am more than happy with this product.
604	Poor Construction.
605	This is infuriating.
606	Overall, I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.
607	Sprint charges for this service.
608	It is cheap, and it feel and look just as cheap.
609	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
610	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
611	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
612	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
613	I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.
614	the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
615	the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.
616	Poor product.
617	However I needed some better instructions.
618	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
619	Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).
620	Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.
621	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
622	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.
623	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.
624	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
625	Very Dissapointing Performance.
626	Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.
627	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
628	Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.
629	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.
630	Don't bother - go to the store.
631	I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone, but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!
632	I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.
633	You get what you pay for I guess.
634	Not only did the software do a great job of this, I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.
635	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
636	These are fabulous!
637	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.
638	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
639	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
640	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.
641	Very wind-resistant.
642	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.
643	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.
644	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.
645	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
646	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.
647	Great phone.
648	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.
649	I'm pleased.
650	Battery is terrible.
651	I found the product to be easy to set up and use.
652	The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.
653	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
654	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.
655	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.
656	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
657	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.
658	Talk about USELESS customer service.
659	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."
660	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
661	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.
662	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.
663	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
664	Does everything it should and more.
665	I could not recommend these more.
666	Nice Sound.
667	Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
668	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
669	Setup went very smoothly.
670	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
671	"A must study for anyone interested in the ""worst sins"" of industrial design."
672	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
673	It is well made, easy to access the phone and has a handy, detachable belt clip.
674	Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.
675	Can't upload ringtones from a third party.
676	Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
677	Truly awful.
678	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.
679	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
680	And none of the tones is acceptable.
681	camera color balance is AWFUL.
682	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.
683	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
684	Chinese Forgeries Abound!.
685	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.
686	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
687	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
688	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
689	Works well.
690	The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.
691	Clear crisp sound.
692	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.
693	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
694	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
695	Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.
696	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
697	It doesn't make you look cool.
698	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.
699	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
700	Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
701	You can't beat the price on these.
702	* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots, and even flash SOS signals (seriously!
703	lightweight and works well.
704	So just beware.
705	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
706	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
707	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
708	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.
709	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
710	Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.
711	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.
712	Poor quality.
713	"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!."
714	Not worth it.
715	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
716	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.
717	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).
718	It was a great phone.
719	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
720	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.
721	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
722	This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!
723	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
724	"In the span of an hour, I had two people exclaim ""Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?"
725	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
726	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
727	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.
728	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
729	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
730	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
731	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.
732	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
733	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
734	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
735	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.
736	Krussel Always good.
737	The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.
738	The design is very good.4.
739	I great reception all the time.
740	I would highly recommend this product.
741	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!
742	It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.
743	Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.
744	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
745	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
746	stay away from this store, be careful.
747	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
748	Does not fit.
749	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
750	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.
751	disappointing.
752	Blue Ant is easy to use.
753	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
754	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
755	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
756	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
757	The nano stated it.My son was dissapointed.
758	The sound quality is excellent as well.
759	Its the best headset I have used.
760	Would not reccommend.
761	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.
762	Just what I wanted.
763	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
764	wont work right or atleast for me.
765	in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.
766	"But now that it is ""out of warranty"" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it."
767	I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good
768	Great product.
769	Crisp and Clear.
770	AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes.
771	VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.
772	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.
773	The reception has been generally good.
774	Excellent sound, battery life and inconspicuous to boot!.
775	Great bluetooth!.
776	I highly recommend this case.
777	WORTHWHILE.
778	This is a great deal.
779	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
780	I am sorry I made this purchase.
781	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
782	Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.
783	It was horrible!.
784	I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.
785	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
786	They work about 2 weeks then break.
787	It is simple to use and I like it.
788	It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!
789	I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
790	NOT WHAT I WANTED.
791	I own 2 of these cases and would order another.
792	Great Phone.
793	I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.
794	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
795	Perfect for the PS3.
796	Five star Plus, plus.
797	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
798	$50 Down the drain.
799	I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it wasn't great.
800	Good , works fine.
801	For the price this was a great deal.
802	Great price, too!
803	If there is a wind, it is completely useless.
804	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
805	Does Not Work.
806	At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).
807	The reception through this headset is excellent.
808	2 thumbs up to this seller
809	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
810	Improper description.... I had to return it.
811	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.
812	Battery charge-life is quite long.
813	The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.
814	Battery has no life.
815	I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.
816	Product is exactly as described.
817	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
818	Doesn't do the job.
819	I would recommend it.
820	Plan on ordering from them again and again.
821	That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.
822	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
823	They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).
824	Awkward to use and unreliable.
825	The shipping time was also very quick!
826	Not as good as I had hoped.
827	Good case!.
828	Doesn't Work.
829	Really good product.
830	Unfortunately it did not work.
831	All three broke within two months of use.
832	dont buy it.
833	My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.
834	However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.
835	The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
836	Horrible, horrible protector.
837	I don't like this Nokia either.
838	Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.
839	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
840	It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.
841	the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!
842	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
843	Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.
844	It's not what it says it is.
845	Stay Away From the Q!.
846	Used and dirty.
847	Very unreliable service from T-mobile !
848	Not good enough for the price.
849	I bought two of them and neither will charge.
850	It looks very nice.
851	This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.
852	I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
853	These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.
854	Comfortable in my hand.
855	Just does not work.
856	Poor Reliability.
857	(It works!)
858	If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.
859	Terrible product, and waste of money!
860	Last time buying from you.
861	It was a waste of my money.
862	So far it has worked like a charm.
863	I have only had it for a few weeks, but so far, so good.
864	But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
865	Would recommend this item.
866	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
867	Nice case, feels good in your hands.
868	The item received was Counterfeit.
869	Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.
870	Works fine.
871	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
872	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
873	My sister has one also and she loves it.
874	Good Quality.
875	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
876	Excellent dual-purpose headset.
877	Excellent!.
878	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
879	It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.
880	The bottowm line...another worthless, cheap gimmick from Sprint.
881	Having trouble with volume.
882	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
883	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.
884	I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.
885	When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
886	I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.
887	Best headset ever!!!.
888	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
889	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
890	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
891	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
892	Excellent product for the price.
893	Bad Reception.
894	This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!
895	It was quite comfortable in the ear.
896	Great phone.
897	Don't buy this product - It fails!.
898	Everything about this product is wrong.First
899	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
900	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
901	Terrible phone holder.
902	The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.
903	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.
904	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
905	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
906	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
907	How stupid is that?
908	I can hear while I'm driving in the car, and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.
909	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
910	Good show, Samsung.
911	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
912	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
913	Couldn't figure it out
914	My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
915	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
916	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.
917	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
918	Works for me.
919	Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
920	much better than the hard plastic cases.
921	It also had a new problem.
922	Happy so far!.
923	cool phone.
924	Works good.
925	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
926	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.
927	but it is great, i would really recommend it
928	Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.
929	As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!
930	Never got it!!!!!
931	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
932	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
933	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
934	"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."""
935	However, after about a year, the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and I couldn't receive and place calls.
936	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.
937	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
938	Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.
939	I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.
940	A lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do I.
941	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
942	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
943	I'm returning them.
944	I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.
945	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
946	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
947	Otherwise, easy to install and use, clear sound.
948	nice leather.
949	I had to purchase a different case.
950	It is a joy to use.
951	Very much disappointed with this company.
952	Very satisifed with that.
953	It didn't charge for me.
954	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
955	Buttons are too small.
956	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
957	Love it.. Great armband.
958	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
959	However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
960	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
961	I was very impressed with the price of the cases.
962	Also makes it easier to hold on to.
963	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
964	It's pretty easy.
965	I cannot make calls at certain places.
966	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
967	Beautiful styling though.
968	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
969	I'm trying to return it for a refund.
970	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
971	Excellent product.
972	Earbud piece breaks easily.
973	Lousy product.
974	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
975	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
976	SWEETEST PHONE!!!
977	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
978	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
979	Not enough volume.
980	Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory
981	you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.
982	don't waste your money.
983	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
984	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
985	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
986	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.
987	Phone falls out easily.
988	It didn't work, people can not hear me when I talk.
989	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
990	I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.
991	Painful on the ear.
992	Lasted one day and then blew up.
993	disappointed.
994	Kind of flops around.
995	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
996	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
997	Item Does Not Match Picture.
998	The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).
999	You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!
1000	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  
1001	Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  
1002	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  
1003	Very little music or anything to speak of.  
1004	The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  
1005	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
1006	Wasted two hours.  
1007	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  
1008	A bit predictable.  
1009	Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  
1010	And those baby owls were adorable.  
1011	The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  
1012	The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  
1013	It Was So Cool.  
1014	"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "
1015	It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  
1016	This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  
1017	I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  
1018	"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "
1019	""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  "
1020	I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  
1021	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  
1022	How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  
1023	It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  
1024	Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  
1025	This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
1026	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
1027	This is the number one best TH game in the series.  
1028	It deserves strong love.  
1029	It is an insane game.  
1030	There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  
1031	Waste your money on this game.  
1032	This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  
1033	Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  
1034	Today the graphics are crap.  
1035	As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  
1036	This game rocks.  
1037	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  
1038	It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  
1039	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  
1040	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
1041	I wasn't the least bit interested.  
1042	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  
1043	But it's just not funny.  
1044	But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  
1045	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  
1046	The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  
1047	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  
1048	But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  
1049	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  
1050	I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
1051	In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  
1052	It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  
1053	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  
1054	Long, whiny and pointless.  
1055	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  
1056	Excellent cast, story line, performances.  
1057	Totally believable.  
1058	Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  
1059	Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  
1060	I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
1061	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
1062	I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
1063	I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  
1064	I was very disappointed in the movie.  
1065	One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  
1066	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  
1067	There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  
1068	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
1069	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
1070	And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
1071	Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  
1072	It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  
1073	There are some generally great things in it.  
1074	I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  
1075	The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  
1076	I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  
1077	If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
1078	Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  
1079	He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  
1080	"I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained ""movie business"" of Québec.  "
1081	This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
1082	If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  
1083	Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  
1084	Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  
1085	Give this one a look.  
1086	I gave it a 10  
1087	The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
1088	It is a true classic.  
1089	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
1090	Definitely worth checking out.  
1091	The problem was the script.  
1092	It was horrendous.  
1093	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
1094	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
1095	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
1096	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
1097	The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  
1098	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
1099	"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  "
1100	I don't think you will be disappointed.  
1101	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  
1102	The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  
1103	It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  
1104	Too politically correct.  
1105	Very disappointing.  
1106	The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  
1107	I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
1108	An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  
1109	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  
1110	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  
1111	The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
1112	The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  
1113	), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
1114	The directing seems too pretentious.  
1115	"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "
1116	And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  
1117	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  
1118	"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  "
1119	I really liked that.  
1120	A great film by a great director.  
1121	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  
1122	The music in the film is really nice too.  
1123	I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
1124	Brilliant!  
1125	10/10  
1126	I liked this movie way too much.  
1127	My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  
1128	It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
1129	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  
1130	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  
1131	There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  
1132	"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  "
1133	All in all, a great disappointment.  
1134	"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "
1135	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
1136	I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  
1137	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  
1138	"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "
1139	Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  
1140	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
1141	All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  
1142	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  
1143	You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  
1144	This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
1145	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  
1146	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
1147	A truly, truly bad film.  
1148	The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  
1149	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
1150	I paid too much.  
1151	Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  
1152	It was so BORING!  
1153	No plot whatsoever!  
1154	Again, no plot at all.  
1155	Horrible!  
1156	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  
1157	I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
1158	I hate movies like that.  
1159	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  
1160	THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
1161	If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
1162	Awful.  
1163	I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  
1164	It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  
1165	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
1166	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
1167	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
1168	Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  
1169	Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  
1170	I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  
1171	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
1172	I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  
1173	I mean this in a terrible way.  
1174	This film has no redeeming features.  
1175	Everything is appalling.  
1176	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  
1177	The story is beyond stupid.  
1178	The script iswas there a script?  
1179	The kids are annoying.  
1180	The lead man is charisma-free.  
1181	Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  
1182	I'll even say it again  this is torture.  
1183	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
1184	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
1185	Highly unrecommended.  
1186	If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  
1187	Yes, it's that bad.  
1188	Nothing at all to recommend.  
1189	An excellent performance from Ms.  
1190	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
1191	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
1192	This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  
1193	There were too many close ups.  
1194	But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
1195	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
1196	"""You'll love it!  "
1197	This movie is BAD.  
1198	So bad.  
1199	The film is way too long.  
1200	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  
1201	The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  
1202	John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  
1203	His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  
1204	I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  
1205	I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  
1206	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  
1207	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
1208	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  
1209	Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  
1210	His performance is simply genius.  
1211	"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  "
1212	""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  "
1213	Ray Charles is legendary.  
1214	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  
1215	Hitchcock is a great director.  
1216	Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  
1217	Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  
1218	It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  
1219	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
1220	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  
1221	There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  
1222	Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  
1223	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
1224	The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  
1225	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  
1226	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  
1227	Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  
1228	When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  
1229	I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  
1230	However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  
1231	I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  
1232	The character developments also lacked in depth.  
1233	Woa, talk about awful.  
1234	Do not waste your time.  
1235	It was just too horrible.  
1236	The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  
1237	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  
1238	The poor actors.  
1239	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  
1240	If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  
1241	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  
1242	If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  
1243	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  
1244	Regrettably, the film fails.  
1245	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
1246	No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  
1247	Yet, I enjoy watching it.  
1248	Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  
1249	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  
1250	The dialogue sucked.  
1251	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  
1252	The soundtrack sucked.  
1253	The acting sucked.  
1254	The concert sequences just sucked.  
1255	That was nice.  
1256	That was funny.  
1257	It was so funny.  
1258	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
1259	But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  
1260	I came out of it feeling angry.  
1261	***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  
1262	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  
1263	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  
1264	And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  
1265	All things considered, a job very well done.  
1266	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  
1267	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  
1268	It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  
1269	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  
1270	It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  
1271	Up there with the best of Melville.  
1272	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  
1273	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  
1274	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  
1275	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  
1276	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  
1277	I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  
1278	If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  
1279	There is a lot of beautiful places.  
1280	It was forced, like everything in this movie.  
1281	Again, lame.  
1282	Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  
1283	And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  
1284	When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  
1285	Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  
1286	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  
1287	The acting was bad.  
1288	Really bad.  
1289	Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  
1290	Camerawork - again, bad.  
1291	Rating: 1 out of 10.  
1292	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  
1293	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  
1294	He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  
1295	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  
1296	Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  
1297	And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  
1298	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  
1299	I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
1300	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  
1301	10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  
1302	I literally vomited while watching this film.  
1303	I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  
1304	his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  
1305	the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  
1306	In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  
1307	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  
1308	I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  
1309	"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  "
1310	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  
1311	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  
1312	This is such a fun and funny movie.  
1313	Highly entertaining at all angles.  
1314	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  
1315	So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  
1316	It even has its sweet moments.  
1317	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
1318	All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  
1319	And I really did find them funny.  
1320	This is actually a very smart movie.  
1321	There is a brilliant twist ending.  
1322	""" I love it.  "
1323	The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  
1324	I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  
1325	I will never forget it now.  
1326	It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  
1327	Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  
1328	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  
1329	This movie is terrible.  
1330	The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  
1331	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  
1332	To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  
1333	Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  
1334	In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  
1335	It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
1336	The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
1337	By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  
1338	Glad I didn't pay to see it.  
1339	Didn't laugh or even smile once.  
1340	But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  
1341	It is a really good show to watch.  
1342	It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  
1343	Barney is definitely super DE duper.  
1344	is pretty funny.  
1345	Babie Bop is very cute.  
1346	The kids are very cool too.  
1347	""" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  "
1348	It's just lame.  
1349	The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
1350	Everything about this movie is stupid.  
1351	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  
1352	It is shameful.  
1353	I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  
1354	"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  "
1355	I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  
1356	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  
1357	I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  
1358	I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  
1359	The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  
1360	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  
1361	Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  
1362	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  
1363	Definitely worth checking out.  
1364	Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  
1365	This movie has a cutting edge to it.  
1366	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  
1367	The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  
1368	I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  
1369	It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  
1370	The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  
1371	The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  
1372	There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
1373	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  
1374	If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  
1375	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  
1376	This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  
1377	I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  
1378	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  
1379	Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  
1380	All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  
1381	God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  
1382	"I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of ""wonder"") are the excerpts from his works.  "
1383	The sets (especially designed to work with the camera) are amazing....stylized, beautiful and effective.  
1384	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  
1385	The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art.  
1386	After watching this film, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist.  
1387	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  
1388	Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  
1389	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.  
1390	"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".  "
1391	This is high adventure at its best.  
1392	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  
1393	Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  
1394	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  
1395	Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
1396	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  
1397	Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  
1398	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  
1399	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  
1400	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  
1401	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  
1402	It was very popular when I was in the cinema, a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs.  
1403	It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  
1404	It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  
1405	I rather enjoyed it.  
1406	I liked it.  
1407	I couldn't take them seriously.  
1408	It really created a unique feeling though.  
1409	Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  
1410	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
1411	Her role was played well.  
1412	Not too screamy not to masculine but just right.  
1413	The camera really likes her in this movie.  
1414	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
1415	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  
1416	I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  
1417	Even worse than Ticker!  
1418	& That movie was bad.  
1419	Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  
1420	It just blew.  
1421	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  
1422	I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  
1423	Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  
1424	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.  
1425	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  
1426	I wish I could enter negative values, admins?  
1427	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  
1428	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
1429	Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  
1430	I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  
1431	I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  
1432	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
1433	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
1434	1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  
1435	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  
1436	The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  
1437	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  
1438	"Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale.  "
1439	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  
1440	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  
1441	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  
1442	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  
1443	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  
1444	Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  
1445	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  
1446	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  
1447	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
1448	My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
1449	I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  
1450	Wow, what a bad film.  
1451	Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  
1452	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  
1453	Not even good for camp value!  
1454	I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  
1455	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  
1456	This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  
1457	If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
1458	This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  
1459	This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  
1460	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  
1461	Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  
1462	Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  
1463	But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  
1464	The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  
1465	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
1466	Whatever the producer was going for, he missed entirely.  
1467	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
1468	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
1469	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.  
1470	Even the squibs look awful.  
1471	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  
1472	The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  
1473	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  
1474	I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  
1475	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  
1476	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  
1477	The directing is sloppy at best.  
1478	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  
1479	Of course, the acting is blah.  
1480	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
1481	And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  
1482	I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  
1483	I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  
1484	This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  
1485	This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  
1486	Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  
1487	Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  
1488	I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning, and even less meaning.  
1489	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  
1490	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  
1491	This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  
1492	But this movie really got to me.  
1493	See it.  
1494	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  
1495	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  
1496	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  
1497	I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  
1498	Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  
1499	Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
1500	The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  
1501	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  
1502	Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  
1503	The rest of the cast also play well.  
1504	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  
1505	About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts.  
1506	About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
1507	By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  
1508	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
1509	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
1510	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  
1511	The cast is good.  
1512	For that, it's worth checking out.  
1513	This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
1514	It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  
1515	Everything about it is just bad.  
1516	I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
1517	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  
1518	The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  
1519	Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
1520	It is zillion times away from reality.  
1521	Watching washing machine twirling around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show.  
1522	Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
1523	20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  
1524	Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
1525	From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  
1526	His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing.  
1527	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
1528	Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me!  
1529	(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
1530	there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
1531	the cast was great.  
1532	steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle-aged, upper class, uptight white guy.  
1533	add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
1534	but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
1535	first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  
1536	the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  
1537	putting the race card aside, lets look at the major flaw in the film: they destroy latifa's character.  
1538	there is no real plot.  
1539	i wouldnt see this movie again for free.  
1540	STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  
1541	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  
1542	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
1543	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  
1544	"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "
1545	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  
1546	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  
1547	I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
1548	The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
1549	John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  
1550	I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  
1551	This may be the only bad film he ever made.  
1552	So bad...well...it's just bad.  
1553	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
1554	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
1555	I thought it was bad.  
1556	Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  
1557	Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  
1558	The script is a big flawed mess.  
1559	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
1560	"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  "
1561	The movie is terribly boring in places.  
1562	The lighting is awful.  
1563	The film looks cheap and bland.  
1564	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  
1565	This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  
1566	The visual effects were AWFUL.  
1567	The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  
1568	"The ""explosion"" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  "
1569	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  
1570	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  
1571	"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  "
1572	Not recommended.  
1573	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
1574	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  
1575	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
1576	Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  
1577	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
1578	With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
1579	The budget was evidently very limited.  
1580	This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
1581	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  
1582	Filmiing was less expansive.  
1583	It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
1584	Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
1585	Not recommended.  
1586	Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
1587	There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
1588	Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  
1589	Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  
1590	I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
1591	Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  
1592	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  
1593	"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  "
1594	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
1595	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  
1596	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
1597	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  
1598	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
1599	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  
1600	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
1601	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
1602	I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  
1603	What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
1604	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
1605	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
1606	The story line is just awful!  
1607	It's just painful!  
1608	And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  
1609	There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
1610	Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
1611	I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  
1612	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  
1613	Go watch it!  
1614	Omit watching this.  
1615	VERY funny!  
1616	My rating: just 3 out of 10.  
1617	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  
1618	An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  
1619	Don't miss it.  
1620	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  
1621	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  
1622	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  
1623	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  
1624	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
1625	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  
1626	Avoid at all costs.  
1627	I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  
1628	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  
1629	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  
1630	I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  
1631	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
1632	I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  
1633	I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  
1634	He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  
1635	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  
1636	Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  
1637	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  
1638	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
1639	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
1640	But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  
1641	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
1642	There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  
1643	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  
1644	Overall, a delight!  
1645	This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  
1646	The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  
1647	The least said about the acting the better.  
1648	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  
1649	I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
1650	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
1651	The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  
1652	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  
1653	Excellent performance.  
1654	There still are good actors around!  
1655	Also great directing and photography.  
1656	Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  
1657	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  
1658	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
1659	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
1660	This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  
1661	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  
1662	"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  "
1663	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  
1664	Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  
1665	"Unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  "
1666	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  
1667	It is not good.  
1668	Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  
1669	Then the film just dropped the ball.  
1670	This is a stunning movie.  
1671	Raw and sublimely moving.  
1672	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  
1673	All of the main players are mesmerising.  
1674	Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  
1675	Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  
1676	He's a national treasure.  
1677	GO AND SEE IT!  
1678	This is an excellent film.  
1679	The aerial scenes were well-done.  
1680	It was also the right balance of war and love.  
1681	"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  "
1682	Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  
1683	A good film by a great director!  
1684	This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  
1685	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  
1686	This is just a great movie.  
1687	10 out of 10 stars.  
1688	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
1689	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
1690	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  
1691	Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates a film like no other.  
1692	This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  
1693	I advise you to look out for it.  
1694	You wont regret it!  
1695	Highly recommended A+  
1696	Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
1697	It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  
1698	It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
1699	) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  
1700	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  
1701	How awful she is!  
1702	But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  
1703	The results, well, are a shame.  
1704	DELETE this film from your mind!  
1705	One of the worst shows of all time.  
1706	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
1707	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  
1708	Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
1709	"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  "
1710	The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  
1711	Lame would be the best way to describe it.  
1712	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  
1713	The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
1714	The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  
1715	Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  
1716	The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  
1717	You can find better movies at youtube.  
1718	Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  
1719	"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  "
1720	That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
1721	So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  
1722	"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
1723	It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  
1724	Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  
1725	Avoid, avoid, avoid!  
1726	It will drive you barking mad!  
1727	The transfers are very good.  
1728	Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  
1729	The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  
1730	) some great music, and terrific scenery.  
1731	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  
1732	) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  
1733	The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  
1734	It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
1735	Nothing new there.  
1736	That was done in the second movie.  
1737	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
1738	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
1739	What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  
1740	I just saw this film and I recommend it.  
1741	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  
1742	A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  
1743	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
1744	Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  
1745	Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  
1746	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  
1747	Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  
1748	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  
1749	I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  
1750	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
1751	But I thought his acting was skilled.  
1752	Meredith M was better than all right.  
1753	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  
1754	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
1755	Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  
1756	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  
1757	This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  
1758	A standout scene.  
1759	This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  
1760	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  
1761	It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  
1762	The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  
1763	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  
1764	This movie is also revealing.  
1765	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  
1766	And it was boring.  
1767	I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  
1768	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  
1769	It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  
1770	"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  "
1771	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  
1772	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  
1773	"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "
1774	Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  
1775	You won't forget this movie!  
1776	Why was this film made?  
1777	The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  
1778	The result is a film that just don't look right.  
1779	None of them are engaging or exciting.  
1780	The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
1781	The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  
1782	"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was ""The Stranger"" and I loved it.  "
1783	But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
1784	This movie is so awesome!  
1785	I loved it, it was really scary.  
1786	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  
1787	If you want a real scare rent this one!  
1788	10/10  
1789	This is an extraordinary film.  
1790	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  
1791	This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  
1792	The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  
1793	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  
1794	Predictable, but not a bad watch.  
1795	It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  
1796	She carries the movie well.  
1797	Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
1798	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  
1799	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  
1800	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  
1801	Avoid at ALL costs!  
1802	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
1803	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
1804	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
1805	The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  
1806	The worst one of the series.  
1807	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
1808	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  
1809	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  
1810	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  
1811	This film offers many delights and surprises.  
1812	"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  "
1813	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  
1814	You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  
1815	But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  
1816	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
1817	You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  
1818	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  
1819	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
1820	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  
1821	Conclusion - I loved it.  
1822	It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
1823	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
1824	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  
1825	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  
1826	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
1827	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  
1828	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  
1829	Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  
1830	See it with your kids if you have a chance--it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years.  
1831	See both films if you can.  
1832	"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  "
1833	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  
1834	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  
1835	It's very slow.  
1836	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
1837	) Don't waste your time.  
1838	End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  
1839	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
1840	This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
1841	I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  
1842	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  
1843	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  
1844	""" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  "
1845	Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  
1846	Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  
1847	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  
1848	Lots of holes in the script.  
1849	It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  
1850	Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  
1851	The dialogue is atrocious.  
1852	The acting is beyond abysmal.  
1853	Everything stinks.  
1854	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  
1855	Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  
1856	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  
1857	In short, don't bother with this movie.  
1858	I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  
1859	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  
1860	If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  
1861	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  
1862	A film not easily forgotten.  
1863	But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  
1864	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
1865	The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  
1866	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  
1867	Great movie!  
1868	Also the story and acting were weak.  
1869	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  
1870	Either way, it sucks.  
1871	The script is horrendously stupid.  
1872	The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  
1873	Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  
1874	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  
1875	Then, there's the plot holes.  
1876	You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  
1877	Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  
1878	She's poised and amazing.  
1879	Dee Snider just plain sucks.  
1880	He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  
1881	I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  
1882	The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  
1883	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
1884	This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  
1885	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
1886	Avoid at any and all costs.  
1887	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  
1888	Avoid this film at all costs.  
1889	I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  
1890	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  
1891	Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
1892	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  
1893	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  
1894	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  
1895	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  
1896	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  
1897	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  
1898	"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "
1899	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  
1900	Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  
1901	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
1902	As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  
1903	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  
1904	I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  
1905	One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  
1906	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
1907	Hated it.  
1908	This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
1909	I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  
1910	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
1911	This is not movie-making.  
1912	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  
1913	So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  
1914	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  
1915	I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  
1916	Excellent short film.  
1917	Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  
1918	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  
1919	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  
1920	The story line is totally predictable.  
1921	Not much dialogue, not much music, the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture.  
1922	I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
1923	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  
1924	Really awful.  
1925	Not easy to watch.  
1926	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  
1927	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  
1928	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
1929	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
1930	I rate this movie 9/10.  
1931	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  
1932	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  
1933	"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "
1934	For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  
1935	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  
1936	The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
1937	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  
1938	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  
1939	The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
1940	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  
1941	"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "
1942	This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  
1943	Go rent it.  
1944	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  
1945	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  
1946	Brilliance indeed.  
1947	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
1948	Think of the film being like a dream.  
1949	Simply beautiful.  
1950	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
1951	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  
1952	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  
1953	"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
1954	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
1955	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
1956	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
1957	"It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the ""gadget"".  "
1958	I enjoyed it.  
1959	I have recommended it to friends.  
1960	I was particularly pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.  
1961	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  
1962	Their on-screen chemistry, critical to the entire film, is genuine.  
1963	The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  
1964	The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  
1965	The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
1966	Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  
1967	Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
1968	"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "
1969	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  
1970	Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  
1971	The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  
1972	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
1973	This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  
1974	If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
1975	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  
1976	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  
1977	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  
1978	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  
1979	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  
1980	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  
1981	I keep watching it over and over.  
1982	It's a sad movie, but very good.  
1983	If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  
1984	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  
1985	Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  
1986	;) Recommend with confidence!  
1987	This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
1988	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  
1989	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
1990	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  
1991	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  
1992	Lange had become a great actress.  
1993	It looked like a wonderful story.  
1994	I never walked out of a movie faster.  
1995	I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off!  
1996	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  
1997	In a word, it is embarrassing.  
1998	Exceptionally bad!  
1999	All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  
2000	Wow... Loved this place.
2001	Crust is not good.
2002	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.
2003	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
2004	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
2005	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
2006	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
2007	The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.
2008	The fries were great too.
2009	A great touch.
2010	Service was very prompt.
2011	Would not go back.
2012	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.
2013	I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!
2014	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
2015	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
2016	Highly recommended.
2017	Waitress was a little slow in service.
2018	This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.
2019	did not like at all.
2020	The Burrittos Blah!
2021	The food, amazing.
2022	Service is also cute.
2023	I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.
2024	So they performed.
2025	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
2026	- They never brought a salad we asked for.
2027	This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.
2028	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.
2029	The worst was the salmon sashimi.
2030	Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.
2031	This was like the final blow!
2032	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
2033	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
2034	Overall, I like this place a lot.
2035	The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.
2036	Ample portions and good prices.
2037	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.
2038	My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
2039	Service sucks.
2040	The shrimp tender and moist.
2041	There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.
2042	Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.
2043	On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.
2044	Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.
2045	The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.
2046	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
2047	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.
2048	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
2049	My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.
2050	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
2051	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
2052	Their chow mein is so good!
2053	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.
2054	The portion was huge!
2055	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.
2056	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
2057	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.
2058	The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.
2059	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
2060	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
2061	This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!
2062	The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.
2063	We'd definitely go back here again.
2064	We are so glad we found this place.
2065	Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.
2066	Always a great time at Dos Gringos!
2067	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
2068	We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.
2069	A great way to finish a great.
2070	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.
2071	- Really, really good rice, all the time.
2072	The service was meh.
2073	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.
2074	I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.
2075	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
2076	2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
2077	The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.
2078	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
2079	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
2080	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
2081	walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.
2082	The turkey and roast beef were bland.
2083	This place has it!
2084	The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.
2085	I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
2086	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
2087	All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!
2088	Omelets are to die for!
2089	Everything was fresh and delicious!
2090	In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.
2091	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.
2092	Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!
2093	Best breakfast buffet!!!
2094	say bye bye to your tip lady!
2095	We'll never go again.
2096	Will be back again!
2097	Food arrived quickly!
2098	It was not good.
2099	On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.
2100	Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!
2101	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.
2102	Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.
2103	I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.
2104	This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.
2105	So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!
2106	The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!
2107	The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.
2108	Will go back next trip out.
2109	Sooooo good!!
2110	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.
2111	At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.
2112	This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.
2113	Nice, spicy and tender.
2114	Good prices.
2115	Check it out.
2116	It was pretty gross!
2117	I've had better atmosphere.
2118	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
2119	Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.
2120	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
2121	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.
2122	Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.
2123	The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.
2124	We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.
2125	Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!
2126	Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...
2127	Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.
2128	I wouldn't return.
2129	Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
2130	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
2131	Penne vodka excellent!
2132	They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
2133	The management is rude.
2134	Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.
2135	Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
2136	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
2137	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
2138	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
2139	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
2140	Don't do it!!!!
2141	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.
2142	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
2143	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
2144	Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
2145	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
2146	The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.
2147	The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.
2148	I give it 2 thumbs down
2149	We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.
2150	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.
2151	This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
2152	We waited for forty five minutes in vain.
2153	Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
2154	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
2155	the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
2156	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
2157	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
2158	this place is good.
2159	Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.
2160	I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
2161	I was seated immediately.
2162	Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.
2163	Avoid at all cost!
2164	Restaurant is always full but never a wait.
2165	DELICIOUS!!
2166	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
2167	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...
2168	I've never been treated so bad.
2169	Bacon is hella salty.
2170	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
2171	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.
2172	The waitresses are very friendly.
2173	Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!
2174	Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.
2175	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.
2176	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
2177	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.
2178	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.
2179	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
2180	The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.
2181	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
2182	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
2183	It was probably dirt.
2184	Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.
2185	I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.
2186	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
2187	Interesting decor.
2188	What I really like there is the crepe station.
2189	Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.
2190	you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)
2191	Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.
2192	When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.
2193	I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.
2194	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
2195	The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
2196	The live music on Fridays totally blows.
2197	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
2198	Very friendly staff.
2199	It is worth the drive.
2200	I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.
2201	Food was great and so was the serivce!
2202	The warm beer didn't help.
2203	Great brunch spot.
2204	Service is friendly and inviting.
2205	Very good lunch spot.
2206	I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.
2207	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
2208	Must have been an off night at this place.
2209	The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous.
2210	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.
2211	For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.
2212	My friend loved the salmon tartar.
2213	Won't go back.
2214	Extremely Tasty!
2215	Waitress was good though!
2216	Soggy and not good.
2217	The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.
2218	Which are small and not worth the price.
2219	- the food is rich so order accordingly.
2220	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!
2221	The service was a bit lacking.
2222	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.
2223	Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.
2224	It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.
2225	I loved the bacon wrapped dates.
2226	This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
2227	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.
2228	"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."
2229	This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!
2230	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
2231	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.
2232	Very very fun chef.
2233	Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.
2234	Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.
2235	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.
2236	"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
2237	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).
2238	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
2239	Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service.
2240	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
2241	Now this dish was quite flavourful.
2242	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
2243	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.
2244	"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""
2245	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
2246	Seriously flavorful delights, folks.
2247	Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.
2248	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.
2249	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
2250	Owner's are really great people.!
2251	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
2252	The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.
2253	Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.
2254	Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.
2255	We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.
2256	Fantastic service here.
2257	I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.
2258	They know how to make them here.
2259	very tough and very short on flavor!
2260	I hope this place sticks around.
2261	I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.
2262	The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
2263	Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!
2264	The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.
2265	Plus, it's only 8 bucks.
2266	The service was not up to par, either.
2267	Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.
2268	Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
2269	For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.
2270	The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
2271	You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
2272	You can't beat that.
2273	Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.
2274	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
2275	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.
2276	I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.
2277	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
2278	I think not again
2279	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.
2280	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
2281	Service stinks here!
2282	I waited and waited.
2283	This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.
2284	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
2285	Great Pizza and Salads!
2286	Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
2287	We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
2288	This place is amazing!
2289	I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.
2290	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
2291	Just don't know why they were so slow.
2292	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.
2293	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.
2294	I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.
2295	You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.
2296	Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.
2297	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
2298	Never again will I be dining at this place!
2299	The food was excellent and service was very good.
2300	Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
2301	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
2302	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
2303	Food was really boring.
2304	Good Service-check!
2305	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
2306	Will never, ever go back.
2307	As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.
2308	In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.
2309	I did not expect this to be so good!
2310	Fantastic food!
2311	She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
2312	The food was very good.
2313	Never going back.
2314	Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.
2315	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
2316	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.
2317	Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.
2318	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.
2319	All the bread is made in-house!
2320	The only downside is the service.
2321	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.
2322	Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.
2323	A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.
2324	Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
2325	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
2326	You won't be disappointed.
2327	They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.
2328	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.
2329	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
2330	The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.
2331	Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.
2332	We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.
2333	Everything was gross.
2334	I love this place.
2335	Great service and food.
2336	First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!
2337	"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."
2338	OMG, the food was delicioso!
2339	There is nothing authentic about this place.
2340	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
2341	Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.
2342	The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
2343	It's worth driving up from Tucson!
2344	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
2345	Pretty good beer selection too.
2346	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.
2347	Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!
2348	5 stars for the brick oven bread app!
2349	I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.
2350	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
2351	He was terrible!
2352	Everyone is treated equally special.
2353	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
2354	It was delicious!!!
2355	On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.
2356	Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.
2357	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
2358	Best fish I've ever had in my life!
2359	(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
2360	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
2361	This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
2362	Pretty cool I would say.
2363	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
2364	Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
2365	I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.
2366	My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
2367	Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
2368	The staff are great, the ambiance is great.
2369	He deserves 5 stars.
2370	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
2371	They dropped more than the ball.
2372	The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.
2373	They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!
2374	And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.
2375	Best tacos in town by far!!
2376	I took back my money and got outta there.
2377	In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.
2378	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
2379	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
2380	I won't be back.
2381	They have great dinners.
2382	The service was outshining & I definitely recommend the Halibut.
2383	The food was terrible.
2384	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
2385	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
2386	I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
2387	This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
2388	This is a disgrace.
2389	Def coming back to bowl next time
2390	If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.
2391	I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;
2392	I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.
2393	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
2394	Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
2395	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.
2396	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
2397	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
2398	Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.
2399	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
2400	This one is simply a disappointment.
2401	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.
2402	I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
2403	Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.
2404	Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
2405	Left very frustrated.
2406	I'll definitely be in soon again.
2407	Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
2408	Service was fantastic.
2409	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
2410	I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.
2411	Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!
2412	For service, I give them no stars.
2413	I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
2414	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
2415	Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
2416	But now I was completely grossed out.
2417	I really enjoyed eating here.
2418	First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular.
2419	Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end.
2420	From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.
2421	On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.
2422	Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!
2423	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
2424	What a mistake that was!
2425	No complaints!
2426	This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.
2427	Waiter was a jerk.
2428	Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.
2429	These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.
2430	I never come again.
2431	We loved the biscuits!!!
2432	Service is quick and friendly.
2433	Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.
2434	So absolutley fantastic.
2435	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
2436	definitely will come back here again.
2437	I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
2438	Wow very spicy but delicious.
2439	If you're not familiar, check it out.
2440	I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
2441	I'd love to go back.
2442	Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.
2443	Nothing special.
2444	Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!
2445	Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!
2446	Will not be back.
2447	Sauce was tasteless.
2448	The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.
2449	My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
2450	I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.
2451	Food was so gooodd.
2452	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
2453	I was so insulted.
2454	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
2455	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
2456	The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.
2457	Nargile - I think you are great.
2458	Best tater tots in the southwest.
2459	We loved the place.
2460	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
2461	The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
2462	Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot.
2463	The manager was the worst.
2464	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
2465	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
2466	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
2467	This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.
2468	Love the margaritas, too!
2469	This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
2470	Very good, though!
2471	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
2472	Great pork sandwich.
2473	Don't waste your time here.
2474	Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.
2475	Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
2476	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
2477	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
2478	We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
2479	I LOVED it!
2480	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
2481	This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I've been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here.
2482	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.
2483	The selection of food was not the best.
2484	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
2485	This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.
2486	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
2487	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
2488	It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.
2489	How awesome is that.
2490	I will be back many times soon.
2491	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
2492	Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.
2493	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
2494	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
2495	And then tragedy struck.
2496	The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
2497	This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!
2498	Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.
2499	Waitress was sweet and funny.
2500	I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!
2501	I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.
2502	Cant say enough good things about this place.
2503	The ambiance was incredible.
2504	The waitress and manager are so friendly.
2505	I would not recommend this place.
2506	Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.
2507	My gyro was basically lettuce only.
2508	Terrible service!
2509	Thoroughly disappointed!
2510	I don't each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here.
2511	Give it a try, you will be happy you did.
2512	By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
2513	Reasonably priced also!
2514	Everything was perfect the night we were in.
2515	The food is very good for your typical bar food.
2516	it was a drive to get there.
2517	At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.
2518	Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.
2519	Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.
2520	Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.
2521	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
2522	A greasy, unhealthy meal.
2523	first time there and might just be the last.
2524	Those burgers were amazing.
2525	Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.
2526	And it was way to expensive.
2527	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
2528	This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
2529	The bartender was also nice.
2530	Everything was good and tasty!
2531	This place is two thumbs up....way up.
2532	The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.
2533	If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.
2534	Terrible management.
2535	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
2536	If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.
2537	Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.
2538	Worst martini ever!
2539	The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
2540	I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
2541	We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).
2542	The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
2543	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
2544	No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
2545	Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
2546	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
2547	"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""
2548	The desserts were a bit strange.
2549	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
2550	I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!
2551	Nice ambiance.
2552	I would recommend saving room for this!
2553	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
2554	However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.
2555	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
2556	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
2557	I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.
2558	All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
2559	I *heart* this place.
2560	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
2561	After two I felt disgusting.
2562	A good time!
2563	I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.
2564	Generous portions and great taste.
2565	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
2566	"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
2567	Food was delicious!
2568	AN HOUR... seriously?
2569	I consider this theft.
2570	Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.
2571	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
2572	Waited and waited and waited.
2573	He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.
2574	Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.
2575	The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.
2576	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
2577	Service was good and the company was better!
2578	The staff are also very friendly and efficient.
2579	As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.
2580	Boy was that sucker dry!!.
2581	Over rated.
2582	If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.
2583	Their steaks are 100% recommended!
2584	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
2585	Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
2586	All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.
2587	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
2588	My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.
2589	The kids play area is NASTY!
2590	Great place fo take out or eat in.
2591	The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.
2592	OMG I felt like I had never eaten Thai food until this dish.
2593	"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."
2594	It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.
2595	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
2596	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
2597	It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
2598	I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
2599	Not good for the money.
2600	I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!
2601	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.
2602	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
2603	Good value, great food, great service.
2604	Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.
2605	The food is good.
2606	It was awesome.
2607	I just wanted to leave.
2608	We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!
2609	I will not be eating there again.
2610	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
2611	I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.
2612	The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.
2613	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(
2614	An absolute must visit!
2615	The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
2616	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
2617	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.
2618	They really want to make your experience a good one.
2619	I will not return.
2620	I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.
2621	Very disappointing!!!
2622	The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
2623	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.
2624	Pretty awesome place.
2625	Ambience is perfect.
2626	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
2627	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
2628	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
2629	The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!
2630	Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
2631	The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!
2632	Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
2633	High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.
2634	Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.
2635	We were promptly greeted and seated.
2636	Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.
2637	I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.
2638	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.
2639	This is a good joint.
2640	The Macarons here are insanely good.
2641	I'm not eating here!
2642	Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.
2643	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
2644	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
2645	Very bad Experience!
2646	What a mistake.
2647	Food was average at best.
2648	Great food.
2649	We won't be going back anytime soon!
2650	Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
2651	Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.
2652	It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.
2653	Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.
2654	The patio seating was very comfortable.
2655	The fried rice was dry as well.
2656	Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!
2657	"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
2658	It was just not a fun experience.
2659	The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested.
2660	I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).
2661	Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!
2662	The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.
2663	Both great!
2664	Eclectic selection.
2665	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
2666	The staff was very attentive.
2667	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
2668	The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.
2669	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
2670	dont go here.
2671	I promise they won't disappoint.
2672	As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
2673	What a great double cheeseburger!
2674	Awesome service and food.
2675	A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!
2676	I can't wait to go back.
2677	The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.
2678	It's a great place and I highly recommend it.
2679	Service was slow and not attentive.
2680	I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.
2681	Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.
2682	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
2683	Very good food, great atmosphere.1
2684	Damn good steak.
2685	Total brunch fail.
2686	Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.
2687	The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.
2688	The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
2689	Good food , good service .
2690	It was absolutely amazing.
2691	I probably won't be back, to be honest.
2692	will definitely be back!
2693	The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.
2694	Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.
2695	Went for lunch - service was slow.
2696	We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.
2697	I was mortified.
2698	Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
2699	Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.
2700	The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.
2701	I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.
2702	Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!
2703	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
2704	The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.
2705	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
2706	The atmosphere here is fun.
2707	Would not recommend to others.
2708	"Service is quick and even ""to go"" orders are just like we like it!"
2709	I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!
2710	That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.
2711	Not my thing.
2712	2 Thumbs Up!!
2713	If you are reading this please don't go there.
2714	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.
2715	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
2716	They have a really nice atmosphere.
2717	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
2718	After one bite, I was hooked.
2719	We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.
2720	Cute, quaint, simple, honest.
2721	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
2722	The food was great as always, compliments to the chef.
2723	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
2724	Awesome selection of beer.
2725	Great food and awesome service!
2726	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.
2727	A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!
2728	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
2729	As for the service, I thought it was good.
2730	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
2731	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
2732	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
2733	Overall, I like there food and the service.
2734	They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.
2735	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.
2736	Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
2737	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.
2738	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.
2739	Never had anything to complain about here.
2740	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
2741	It was way over fried.
2742	I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.
2743	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
2744	Will not be back!
2745	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
2746	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
2747	I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.
2748	I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!
2749	Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
2750	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.
2751	The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.
2752	Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.
2753	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
2754	Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.
2755	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!
2756	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
2757	This is a GREAT place to eat!
2758	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
2759	The service was poor and thats being nice.
2760	Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.
2761	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
2762	The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.
2763	But the service was beyond bad.
2764	"I'm so happy to be here!!!"""
2765	Tasted like dirt.
2766	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
2767	The block was amazing.
2768	It's close to my house, it's low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food.
2769	* Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars!
2770	My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.
2771	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
2772	"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
2773	What did bother me, was the slow service.
2774	The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!
2775	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
2776	These were so good we ordered them twice.
2777	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
2778	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
2779	Unfortunately, it was not good.
2780	I had a pretty satifying experience.
2781	Join the club and get awesome offers via email.
2782	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.
2783	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
2784	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.
2785	The nachos are a MUST HAVE!
2786	We will not be coming back.
2787	I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.
2788	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.
2789	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.
2790	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
2791	Once your food arrives it's meh.
2792	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
2793	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
2794	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
2795	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
2796	The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.
2797	This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2798	Mediocre food.
2799	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
2800	I'm super pissd.
2801	And service was super friendly.
2802	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
2803	This place was such a nice surprise!
2804	They were golden-crispy and delicious.
2805	I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.
2806	I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
2807	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
2808	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.
2809	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.
2810	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
2811	The service was terrible though.
2812	This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!
2813	It was packed!!
2814	I love this place.
2815	I can say that the desserts were yummy.
2816	The food was terrible.
2817	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
2818	It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
2819	This place should honestly be blown up.
2820	But I definitely would not eat here again.
2821	Do not waste your money here!
2822	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
2823	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
2824	Awful service.
2825	Won't ever go here again.
2826	Food quality has been horrible.
2827	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
2828	The service here is fair at best.
2829	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
2830	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
2831	Very poor service.
2832	No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
2833	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.
2834	They were excellent.
2835	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
2836	Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
2837	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
2838	Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
2839	I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
2840	for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.
2841	The food came out at a good pace.
2842	I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad.
2843	I won't be back.
2844	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
2845	This place deserves no stars.
2846	I would not recommend this place.
2847	In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.
2848	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.
2849	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!
2850	the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
2851	I probably would not go here again.
2852	So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.
2853	The price is reasonable and the service is great.
2854	The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
2855	My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.
2856	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.
2857	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
2858	I probably won't be coming back here.
2859	Worst food/service I've had in a while.
2860	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.
2861	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
2862	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
2863	I love their fries and their beans.
2864	Always a pleasure dealing with him.
2865	They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.
2866	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
2867	For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.
2868	The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.
2869	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
2870	I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
2871	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
2872	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.
2873	My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.
2874	Weird vibe from owners.
2875	There was hardly any meat.
2876	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
2877	Go To Place for Gyros.
2878	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!
2879	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.
2880	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
2881	The service was terrible, food was mediocre.
2882	We definately enjoyed ourselves.
2883	I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.
2884	On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.
2885	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
2886	The service was extremely slow.
2887	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.
2888	Seriously killer hot chai latte.
2889	No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
2890	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
2891	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
2892	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
2893	Worst Thai ever.
2894	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
2895	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
2896	The pizza selections are good.
2897	I had strawberry tea, which was good.
2898	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
2899	Overall, a great experience.
2900	Spend your money elsewhere.
2901	Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...!
2902	The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.
2903	And the drinks are WEAK, people!
2904	-My order was not correct.
2905	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
2906	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
2907	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2908	We won't be returning.
2909	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
2910	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
2911	Very, very sad.
2912	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
2913	How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!
2914	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
2915	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
2916	There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better
2917	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
2918	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
2919	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
2920	Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.
2921	This place is disgusting!
2922	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
2923	The RI style calamari was a joke.
2924	However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.
2925	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
2926	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
2927	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
2928	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
2929	Disappointing experience.
2930	The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.
2931	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
2932	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
2933	We won't be going back.
2934	The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.
2935	This place lacked style!!
2936	The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.
2937	Don't bother coming here.
2938	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
2939	The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.
2940	It was equally awful.
2941	Probably not in a hurry to go back.
2942	very slow at seating even with reservation.
2943	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
2944	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
2945	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
2946	It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.
2947	I was VERY disappointed!!
2948	This place is horrible and way overpriced.
2949	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
2950	It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.
2951	The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.
2952	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
2953	Con: spotty service.
2954	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
2955	But then they came back cold.
2956	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
2957	The real disappointment was our waiter.
2958	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
2959	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
2960	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.
2961	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
2962	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
2963	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
2964	Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.
2965	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
2966	But I don't like it.
2967	Hell no will I go back
2968	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
2969	"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
2970	I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.
2971	The ambiance isn't much better.
2972	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
2973	The food wasn't good.
2974	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
2975	What happened next was pretty....off putting.
2976	too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.
2977	Overpriced for what you are getting.
2978	I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.
2979	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
2980	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
2981	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
2982	Food was below average.
2983	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
2984	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
2985	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
2986	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
2987	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
2988	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
2989	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
2990	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
2991	Spend your money and time some place else.
2992	A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.
2993	the presentation of the food was awful.
2994	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
2995	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
2996	Appetite instantly gone.
2997	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
2998	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
2999	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
